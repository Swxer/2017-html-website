<h2> Insecurities </h2>  
<p> For any enterprises nowadays, particularly Microsoft and etc. Network security must be their first priority. Any form of disruption within the network can generate rippling negative effects. Those effects could cost up to a couple of millions, or even billions. Having an extensive understanding exactly how many various methods of making the network vulnerable is a key component to ensure that the network has the maximum security as possible. </p>

<p>However, there are multiple ways of securing your network from any outsiders but people needs to understand that various methods will not make it immune to any breaching. An example of this, making the password much more more complex series of case-sensitive, numbers, and letters. Like previously stated, this will not make your internet immune to any breachings, but this will keep your confidential information safe for a long time. As threats evolve, your security needs to as well.</p>

<h2> What Should You Consider?</h2>	
<p> - Consider anyone who has access to the device via a network connection, including external and internal users. It is your responsibility for giving them an access in the first place. </p>

<p> - Attacker uses vulnerable network services to attack by implanting some malicious programs that will allow them to encrypt the network and obtain what they need. Attacks could come from external or internal users. </p>

<p> - Insecure network services may be likely to be influenced by a harmful piece of software, and this will overflow attacks or attacks that create a denial of service condition, making the device inaccessible by any users. Denial of service attacks against other users may also be more vulnerable when insecure network services are available. Fortunately, Insecure network services can often be detected by automated tools such as port scanners and etc. </p>

<p> - Insecure network services can result in data loss or corruption to a particular stored information, and spreading denial of service of attacks on other devices.</p>
