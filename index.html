<h2>What is a wireless network?</h2>
<p> So, what is a wireless network you may ask? Wireless networks are computer networks that are not connected by cables of any kind. The use of a wireless network enables a big company to avoid the costly process of installing cables into buildings and make things convenient for people to use it anywhere. </p>
<p>  A wireless local-area network (LAN) uses radio waves to connect devices such as laptops to the Internet and to your business network and its applications. When you connect a laptop to a WiFi hotspot at a cafe, hotel, airport lounge, or other public places, you're connecting to that business's wireless network. Business’s network isn’t the only method to connect wirelessly. Another example could be connecting to a router at home with your computer.</p>

<h2>How is a wireless network different to a wired network?</h2>
<p>A wired network connects devices to the Internet or other network using cables. The most common wired networks use of cables connected to Ethernet ports on the network router. The cable is connected all the way to another end of the port on the computer.</p>
<p>Wireless networks do not use any form of cable. The transmission of data (your files, music, printing to the printer etc) occurs over radio waves… just like cordless smart phones you could easily download an item from a various site. The major advantage of having a wireless device is the mobility and freedom that comes with it. Moreover, there is less clutter and fewer wires to worry about. However, you are more prone to insecurities and slower connection speed, as it can be interfered by an unknown source. </p>
	 
<p>But which of the two is better? Many users who have a computer at home, often uses Ethernet cable to connect to a router to access a network.  Nowadays, those who have an Ethernet cable, there is a specific cable that has been used quite often by many users. They usually connect to a router to a computer using Cat5 cables. The speed and security in this scenario are greatly enhanced. People prefer the cable over the wireless connection because it has a low chance of interference by another unknown source. The latest Ethernet routers can support up to 1000Mb/s. Comparing to the wireless connection, it provides freedom, you are free to walk around within the network radius. It is more likely than the cable, that it can be slow occasionally. </p>
