<h2> Types Of Connection You Have Could Make A Difference.</h2>
	
<p> No matter how fast your Internet connection is, there are times when things will slow down to a crawl.<br> 
The Type of network you have could make a huge difference. The type of internet connection you have used is essentially the factor in determining your connection speed. The three most common ways to have your device connect to the internet are dial-up, DSL and cable. If a person were given a choice, cable would normally be the first pick as it is much faster compared to dial-up and dsl. 	
</p> 
	
<p> Many internet service providers may offer a small modification called Fiber Optic Service, which connects to the Internet using light over an optical network. The computer is still connected through the copper wiring. The advantage of FiOS is that it can provide higher speeds than traditional copper wire connections such as DSL or cable.
</p>
	
<p> It is advised that you should check your phone line if it is in good condition. If the telephone wiring in your home is deteriorating, it is likely that you be picking up stray connection from other phone lines. These problems will slow your internet down substantially because the modem will have to send the same information repetitively until it is then transmitted successfully without interruptions.

<h2> Tips for Wireless Network Users</h2>
<p> When you're connecting to a wireless network, your Internet connection speed can be affected by both where your computer is located and whether other wireless devices are within the area. Wireless networks operate on frequencies that are similar to those used by other devices, such as microwave ovens or cordless phones. Example if this, if both of your devices are cordless phone and wireless laptop operates at 2.4GHz, it can cause interference or completely block the wireless connection. If you want to make a phone call while browsing without any lag, it is suggested that you use a wired or wireless phone that operates different frequencies compared to the wireless laptop.
</p>
	
<p> The health of your computer can affect your Internet connection. Spyware and viruses can definitely cause problems, but your Internet connection speed can also be affected by add-on programs, the amount of memory the computer has, hard disk space and condition, and the programs that are running. Monitor your hard drive activity and make adjustments if necessary.
