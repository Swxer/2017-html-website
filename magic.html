<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>    
<p>Every single technology all starts off with a basic computer science. That is the binary numbers which only consist ‘0’ and ‘1’. Everything you see happening on the device actually consists of 0s and 1s. A computer CPU could only recognise two states. ‘Off’ which is represented by ‘0’, and ‘On’ which is presented by ‘1’. </p>
<p>The main difference between Wifi and the Ethernet, is the way it transmits data. With Ethernet, data is converted into an electrical signal carried by a wire. Comparing to Wi-Fi, it is not carried by the wires. Instead, it is carried by radio waves. These waves travel through midair, the only problem for it to travel in air is that it is vulnerable to any disruptions. An example of disruption is a microwave surprisingly. To avoid this disruption as much as possible, the waves are transmitted through a certain number of frequency (Either 2.4GHz or 5Ghz). These waves are sent back and forth between your device and the router, this enables you to access to the internet, and view some content on your browser.</p>

<p>Say you want to send a picture to your friends or whatsoever. The data from the image will be broken down into tiny individual pieces so then it can be transferred easily. It will then be directed to the different router until it reaches somebody else’s device. The packets are then re-assembled to form the images. This form of protocol that manages data management are called TCP/IP. This works similarly like how you send an email via browser. </p>

<h2> What Is TCP/IP?</h2>
<p> Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) and Internet Protocol(IP) are responsible for sending your data over the internet and sharing the content for the interconnect community to look at. Watch the following video to get some insight on TCP/IP.</p>
